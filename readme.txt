The app that I am going to make call "ZBrain", it is a game that design to help the users to exercise their brain that contributing to study better at school, focus at work and importantly maintaining psychological well-being.

There will be different level of the game, the user allows to play to the next level when they are completed the certain level. It will be select the combination of two topics:

    Logic
    Memory match
    Firstly, the logic of the game that is designed to be natural and simple way that can suitable for most people. That involving:

Finding the unique item in the collection of similar things
Selecting to ascending/descending number
Multiple choice question allows the users to select the correct answer base on the knowledge
Secondly, memory match is concentration game that contains matching images with different topics with well design. The board size varies depend on the difficulty per level (2x2 tiles, 3x3 tiles, 4x4 tiles, etc.). All of the cards (images) are laid face down on a surface. In order to play the game, the user need to tap to open up to two cards at any time, and when they are a match then they stay revealed. When they are not match they will face up again. Therefore, player is required to remember cards positions to try and match all cards in the fewest steps possible. There will be the time limit and the number step allow to complete the game.

When the users finish each level, the app will be rating their performances.
